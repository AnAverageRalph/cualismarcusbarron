		<h1>Project Gutenberg Analysis</h1>
		<h2>Context</h2> 
			<p1>Project Gutenberg is a free digital library with a collection of over 75,000 ebooks. It consists of a website where users can search for, view, and download ebooks, and was founded by Michael Hart, who is credited with inventing the ebook in 1971. The site is maintained entirely by volunteers, who digitize new books and edit existing ones whenever errors in the digitization process are discovered. Its collection focuses mainly on public domain materials.</p1>
			<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Their website can be found here.</a>
		<h2>Audience</h2>
			<p2>The intended audience is everyone with an internet connection. However, it is most likely to appeal to those interested in works no newer than the late-1920s.</p2>
		<h2>Content</h2> 
			<p3>The site’s content consists primarily of ebooks. Many are also available as audiobooks, some with human narators and some narrated by a text-to-speech program. There is also small amounts of multimedia content, including short film clips and pictures.</p3>
		<h2>Features</h2>
			<p4>The site uses the LC classification system for its books and has a quick search bar at the top of the page. It also has extensive advanced search options, including searching by author, title, or subject, the file type the book is saved as, full-text searches, searching by language, and lists of books by the first letter of the title or author’s name. There is also a frequently downloaded page, a subject categories page that allows users to view all works in a particular subject, and a large set of reading lists. These include collections by topic such as fiction, education, or music and are created and curated by volunteers.</p4>
		<h2>Pros</h2>
			<p5>There are numerous pros to Project Gutenberg, including but not limited to:</p5>
			<ul>
				<li style="color:green;">it is entirely free to access and use</li>
				<li style="color:green;">it is accessible in a standard web browser and works on both desktop and mobile devices</li>
				<li style="color:green;">its search options are quite flexible</li>
				<li style="color:green;">reading lists give users looking for a particular topic an easy starting point</li>
				<li style="color:green;">the audiobook options make it accessible to the blind or others with significant vision issues</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Cons</h2>
			<p6>However, there are several cons as well:</p6>
			<ul>
				<li style="color:red;">because everything on site must be free, it relies almost exclusively on public domain material, and much of its collection is made up of books written almost 100 years ago. As a result, it is a poor resource for technical, scientific, or history books, since much of the materials present are woefully out of date.</li>
				<li style="color:red;">The site is almost exclusively ebooks with little multimedia content outside of the audiobooks</li>
				<li style="color:red;">the site relies on transcriptions and digitization of print books by volunteers, which are occasionally inaccurate due to errors made by the volunteers. This is openly acknowledged in the site’s mission statement</li>
				<li style="color:red;">many of the audiobooks were made using old text-to-speech programs that have a harsh, electronic sound, do not always pronounce words correctly, and can be difficult to understand</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Potential Improvements</h2>
			<p7>There are not many ways to improve upon Project Gutenberg. The limitations of the catalog are the result of copyright laws that are outside project’s control. The site itself is easy to navigate and has extensive search options. There are really only two points the site could improve upon. The first is expanding its multimedia collection. While the original focus of the site was ebooks, modern libraries include collections of video, audio, and photographic content among other things, and adding a collection of such materials would make the site more attractive to more people. The second is that it would be nice if the site would redo its audiobooks using a more up to date text-to-speech program with a more understandable voice.</p7>
